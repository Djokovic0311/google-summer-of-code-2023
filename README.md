Background:
- About the community cBioPortal: cBioPortal stands as a premier open-source platform dedicated to the exploration, analysis, and visualization of cancer genomics data. This platform serves as a comprehensive hub that amalgamates large-scale datasets, encompassing genomic alterations, gene expression profiles, and pertinent clinical details. Notably, cBioPortal synthesizes data from esteemed sources such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). This data fusion is then made effortlessly accessible via a user-friendly web interface tailored for researchers, medical professionals, and the broader community. To delve deeper into its extensive offerings, one can visit the cBioPortal homepage.

- My Project (Group Comparison) Generic Assay Categorical/Binary data implementation: Our initiative is geared towards embedding the Generic Assay Categorical/Binary data functionality within the cBioPortal's group comparison segment. By doing so, users will gain the capability to investigate and represent categorical as well as binary data in alignment with cancer genomic insights.
